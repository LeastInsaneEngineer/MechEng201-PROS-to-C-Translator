	// This array simulates your encoders. It must be passed into every function you have.
	// As arrays are implicitly pointers, by passing this array into every function, the value in the encoder array will be consistent everywhere.
	// This array is updated by the motorPower() function and can then be used for closedloop controls	
	int encoder[] = { 0,0,0 };
